        p A few girls from the HR department occasionally travel to nearby universities to participate in recruiting events. They bring lots of Barkley promotional materials, as well as a big rocket sign.
        p After taking my <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/MoonshotLab/internet-of-wild-things'>Internet of Wild Thangs Class</a>, one of them had an idea for the rocket. The conversation whent something like this:

        p At this point in my career, I had written several applications which utilized micro controllers, but I had almost no experience with logic chips. I had read a few tutorials about how shift registers could be used to extend the number of outputs from an Arduino. So I wrote a little code, did a lot more soldering than expected, and taped all of it to the back of the rocket. Rocket Surgery.

        p The natural white LEDs give the rocket a nice retro glowing look and a potentiometer on the back allows speed adjustment of the light patterns. Now, when HR takes it to recruiting events, kids like to get their picture taken with the rocket.
        p There’s a little <a target='_blank', href='https://github.com/MoonshotLab/RedRocket'>Github Repo</a> for the code, but I never got around to making a wiring diagram. Check it out:
