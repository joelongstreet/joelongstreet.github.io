          p Is it possible for non technical people to invent and create electronics based prototypes? Can it talk to the internet? Could it be a teddy bear, bag of dog food, or disco ball? Can it be done in two hours? These were some of the first questions asked of me when I started at the Moonshot Lab.
          p After building a few apps (the <a href='https://github.com/MoonshotLab/eddie-o-matic' target='_blank'>Eddie-O-Matic</a>, <a href='https://github.com/MoonshotLab/Market-Watch' target='_blank'>Market Watch</a>) with the spark core, I started thinking about creating a GUI visual programmer. This would allow just about anyone to connect a micro-controller to a recipe based service like <a href='https://ifttt.com/' target='_blank'>IFTTT</a> or <a href='https://zapier.com/' target='_blank'>Zapier</a>. So I <a href='https://github.com/MoonshotLab/internet-of-wild-things' target='_blank'>made it</a>! 
          p I held a few classes which were open to all Barkley employees. The first portion was a short introduction into electronics where students learned how resistors and LEDs worked. The next step was learning how to use the <a href='https://github.com/MoonshotLab/internet-of-wild-things' target='_blank'>wild-thangs</a> app. A quick overview of Zapier and then we hooked all the pieces together. Magic! Everything is now talking to the internet.

          p I was amazed at the creativity and diversity of the prototypes. Some of my favorites were:
          ul
            li A bottle of sunscreen which schedules google calendar events which then remind you to reapply.
            li A television remote with a siren activated from a mobile device. 
            li Sunglasses that light up when someone mentions you in a tweet.

          p Itâ€™s a great feeling to empower others to express their ideas. I really enjoyed teaching these classes and hope to do more in the future. We were even featured in the <a href='http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2014/05/22/barkley-advertising-capitalizes-on-internet-of.html?page=all' target='_blank'>KC Business Journal</a>.
